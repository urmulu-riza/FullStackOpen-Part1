# a- Introduction to React

You may use the new generation frontend tool [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or the default tool [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get started.

```bash
npx create-react-app part1
cd part1
npm start
```

The applicaiton runs on <http://localhost:3000>

The file **_<i>index.js</i>_** looks like this

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

and file **_<i>App.js</i>_** looks like this

```js
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello world</p>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

### Component

The file **_<i>public/index.js</i>_** looks like this :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    content not shown ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

There are a few ways to define functions in JavaScript. Here we will use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), which are described in a newer version of JavaScript known as [ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants), also called ES6.

The first rule of frontend web development:

> <i>keep the console open all the time</i>

Rendering a dynamic content inside of a component:

```js
const App = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world, it is {now.toString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```

### JSX

The layout of React components is mostly written using [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx). Although JSX looks like HTML, we are dealing with a way to write JavaScript. Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.

```js
const App = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    null,
    React.createElement('p', null, 'Hello world, it is ', now.toString())
  );
};
```

The compilation is handled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/).
JSX is "[XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed. For example, a newline is an empty element, which in HTML can be written as follows:

```html
<br />
```

but when writing JSX, the tag needs to be closed:

```html
<br />
```

### Multiple Components

A core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components.

Another strong convention is the idea of a root component called App at the top of the component tree of the application. Nevertheless, as we will learn in part 6, there are situations where the component App is not exactly the root, but is wrapped within an appropriate utility component.

### props: passing data to components

It is possible to pass data to components using so-called [props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component).

```js
const Hello = ({ name, age }) => {
  // highlight-line
  return (
    <div>
      Hello {name}, you are {age} years old // highlight-line
    </div>
  );
};
```

The props are defined as follows:

```js
const App = () => {
  const name = 'Peter'; // highlight-line
  const age = 10; // highlight-line
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} /> // highlight-line
      <Hello name={name} age={age} /> // highlight-line
    </div>
  );
};
```

> Keep in mind that React component names must be capitalized.

> Note that the content of a React component (usually) needs to contain **one root element**.

Using a root element is not the only working option. An <i>array</i> of components is also a valid solution:

```js
const App = () => {
  return [<h1>Greetings</h1>, <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />, <Footer />];
};
```

However, when defining the root component of the application this is not a particularly wise thing to do, and it makes the code look a bit ugly.

Because the root element is stipulated, we have "extra" div elements in the DOM tree. This can be avoided by using [fragments](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment), i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element:

```js
const App = () => {
  const name = 'Peter';
  const age = 10;

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
```

It now compiles successfully, and the DOM generated by React no longer contains the extra div element.

### Do not render objects

Consider an application that prints the names and ages of our friends on the screen:

```js
const App = () => {
  const friends = [
    { name: 'Peter', age: 4 },
    { name: 'Maya', age: 10 },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{friends[0]}</p>
      <p>{friends[1]}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The core of the problem is <i>Objects are not valid as a React child</i>, i.e. the application tries to render <i>objects</i> and it fails again.

In React, the individual things rendered in braces must be primitive values, such as numbers or strings.

The fix is ​​as follows

```js
  ....
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {friends[0].name} {friends[0].age}
      </p>
      <p>
        {friends[1].name} {friends[1].age}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
  ....
```

> React also allows arrays to be rendered if the array contains values ​​that are eligible for rendering (such as numbers or strings).

Famous software developer Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin has stated

> <i>"The only way to go fast, is to go well"</i>

that is, according to Martin, careful progress with small steps is even the only way to be fast.

**WARNING2** create-react-app automatically makes the project a git repository unless the application is created within an already existing repository. Most likely you **do not want** the project to become a repository, so run the command _rm -rf .git_ in the root of the project.

# b- Javascript

The official name of the JavaScript standard is [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). At this moment, the latest version is the one released in June of 2022 with the name [ECMAScript®2022](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/), otherwise known as ES13.

Browsers do not yet support all of JavaScript's newest features. Due to this fact, a lot of code run in browsers has been <i>transpiled</i> from a newer version of JavaScript to an older, more compatible version.

Today, the most popular way to do transpiling is by using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime environment based on Google's [Chrome V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) JavaScript engine and works practically anywhere - from servers to mobile phones. Let's practice writing some JavaScript using Node. The latest versions of Node already understand the latest versions of JavaScript, so the code does not need to be transpiled.

Where to run Node.js:

1.[JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?js,console).

2.the browser's developer tool console

3.Node.js console, which is opened by typing _node_ in the command line

### Variables

```js
const x = 1;
let y = 5;

console.log(x, y); // 1, 5 are printed
y += 10;
console.log(x, y); // 1, 15 are printed
y = 'sometext';
console.log(x, y); // 1, sometext are printed
x = 4; // causes an error
```

> [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)

> The variable's data type can change during execution

[var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var). See [JavaScript Variables - Should You Use let, var or const? on Medium](https://medium.com/craft-academy/javascript-variables-should-you-use-let-var-or-const-394f7645c88f) or [Keyword: var vs. let on JS Tips](http://www.jstips.co/en/javascript/keyword-var-vs-let/) or watch [var, let and const - ES6 JavaScript Features](https://youtu.be/sjyJBL5fkp8) for more information.

### Arrays

```js
const t = [1, -1, 3];

t.push(5);

console.log(t.length); // 4 is printed
console.log(t[1]); // -1 is printed

t.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value); // numbers 1, -1, 3, 5 are printed, each to own line
});
```

Notable in this example is the fact that the contents of the array can be modified even though it is defined as a _const_. Because the array is an object, the variable always points to the same object. However, the content of the array changes as new items are added to it.

forEach calls the function <i>for each of the items in the array</i>, always passing the individual item as an argument. The function as the argument of forEach may also receive [other arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach).

In the previous example, a new item was added to the array using the method [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push).

When using React, techniques from functional programming are often used. One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) data structures. In React code, it is preferable to use the method [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat), which creates a new array with the added item. This ensures the original array remains unchanged.

```js
const m1 = t.map((value) => value * 2);
```

Based on the old array, map creates a <i>new array</i>, for which the function given as a parameter is used to create the items.

```js
const m2 = t.map((value) => '<li>' + value + '</li>');
console.log(m2);
// [ '<li>1</li>', '<li>2</li>', '<li>3</li>' ] is printed
```

[destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

```js
const t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const [first, second, ...rest] = t;

console.log(first, second); // 1, 2 is printed
console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5] is printed
```

### Objects

```js
const object3 = {
  name: {
    first: 'Dan',
    last: 'Abramov',
  },
  grades: [2, 3, 5, 3],
  department: 'Stanford University',
};
```

```js
console.log(object1.name); // Arto Hellas is printed with dot notations
const fieldName = 'age';
console.log(object1[fieldName]); // 35 is printed with brackets []
```

```js
object1.address = 'Helsinki';
object1['secret number'] = 12341;
```

The latter of the additions has to be done by using brackets because of the space.
Naturally, objects in JavaScript can also have methods.

[function declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function).

```js
function product(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const result = product(2, 6);
// result is now 12
```

The other way to define the function is by using a [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function). In this case, there is no need to give the function a name and the definition may reside among the rest of the code:

```js
const average = function (a, b) {
  return (a + b) / 2;
};

const result = average(2, 5);
// result is now 3.5
```

During this course, we will define all functions using the arrow syntax.
