# a- Introduction to React

You may use the new generation frontend tool [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or the default tool [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get started.

```bash
npx create-react-app part1
cd part1
npm start
```

The applicaiton runs on <http://localhost:3000>

The file **_<i>index.js</i>_** looks like this

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

and file **_<i>App.js</i>_** looks like this

```js
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello world</p>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

### Component

The file **_<i>public/index.js</i>_** looks like this :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    content not shown ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

There are a few ways to define functions in JavaScript. Here we will use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), which are described in a newer version of JavaScript known as [ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants), also called ES6.

The first rule of frontend web development:

> <i>keep the console open all the time</i>

Rendering a dynamic content inside of a component:

```js
const App = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world, it is {now.toString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```

### JSX

The layout of React components is mostly written using [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx). Although JSX looks like HTML, we are dealing with a way to write JavaScript. Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.

```js
const App = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    null,
    React.createElement('p', null, 'Hello world, it is ', now.toString())
  );
};
```

The compilation is handled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/).
JSX is "[XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed. For example, a newline is an empty element, which in HTML can be written as follows:

```html
<br />
```

but when writing JSX, the tag needs to be closed:

```html
<br />
```

### Multiple Components

A core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components.

Another strong convention is the idea of a root component called App at the top of the component tree of the application. Nevertheless, as we will learn in part 6, there are situations where the component App is not exactly the root, but is wrapped within an appropriate utility component.

### props: passing data to components

It is possible to pass data to components using so-called [props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component).

```js
const Hello = ({ name, age }) => {
  // highlight-line
  return (
    <div>
      Hello {name}, you are {age} years old // highlight-line
    </div>
  );
};
```

The props are defined as follows:

```js
const App = () => {
  const name = 'Peter'; // highlight-line
  const age = 10; // highlight-line
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} /> // highlight-line
      <Hello name={name} age={age} /> // highlight-line
    </div>
  );
};
```

> Keep in mind that React component names must be capitalized.

> Note that the content of a React component (usually) needs to contain **one root element**.

Using a root element is not the only working option. An <i>array</i> of components is also a valid solution:

```js
const App = () => {
  return [<h1>Greetings</h1>, <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />, <Footer />];
};
```

However, when defining the root component of the application this is not a particularly wise thing to do, and it makes the code look a bit ugly.

Because the root element is stipulated, we have "extra" div elements in the DOM tree. This can be avoided by using [fragments](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment), i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element:

```js
const App = () => {
  const name = 'Peter';
  const age = 10;

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
```

It now compiles successfully, and the DOM generated by React no longer contains the extra div element.

### Do not render objects

Consider an application that prints the names and ages of our friends on the screen:

```js
const App = () => {
  const friends = [
    { name: 'Peter', age: 4 },
    { name: 'Maya', age: 10 },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{friends[0]}</p>
      <p>{friends[1]}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The core of the problem is <i>Objects are not valid as a React child</i>, i.e. the application tries to render <i>objects</i> and it fails again.

In React, the individual things rendered in braces must be primitive values, such as numbers or strings.

The fix is ​​as follows

```js
  ....
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {friends[0].name} {friends[0].age}
      </p>
      <p>
        {friends[1].name} {friends[1].age}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
  ....
```

> React also allows arrays to be rendered if the array contains values ​​that are eligible for rendering (such as numbers or strings).
